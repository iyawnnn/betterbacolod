# Check Garbage Collection Schedules and Request Pickup — Bacolod City

The City Government of Bacolod manages **regular garbage collection** through the **Bacolod Environment and Natural Resources Office (BENRO)** and barangays, with collection services provided by **ISWIMS** (garbage collection consortium).

## Regular Garbage Collection

**How it works:**

- Collection schedules vary **by barangay** (usually **every other day** or **3 times per week**)
- Trucks assigned to barangays cover **household waste**, **biodegradable**, and **residual/non-recyclable** garbage
- Segregation at source is **mandatory** — separate biodegradable, recyclable, residual, and special/hazardous waste

**Where to check schedules:**

1. **Official Waste Collection Schedule** — [bacolodcity.gov.ph/waste-collection-schedule](https://bacolodcity.gov.ph/waste-collection-schedule/)
2. **Barangay Hall** — each barangay posts its official collection schedule
3. **Barangay Facebook Pages** — updates when trucks are delayed or rescheduled
4. **BENRO** announcements for citywide advisories (during holidays or typhoon disruptions)

## Special Garbage Pickup (Bulk or Non-Routine Waste)

For **bulk waste** (furniture, appliances, construction debris, yard trimmings), collection is not part of the regular schedule.

**How to request:**

1. Visit your **Barangay Hall** or contact the **Barangay Environment Committee**
2. Provide details: type of waste, estimated volume, and address
3. Barangay coordinates with **BENRO** for scheduling a **special truck pickup**
4. Some barangays may require a **minimal fee** for bulk or special disposal

**Items usually needing special pickup:**

- Large furniture, mattresses, appliances, e-waste
- Construction/demolition debris
- Hazardous household waste (paints, chemicals, batteries)
