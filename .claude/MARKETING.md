Over the weekend, I built BetterBacolod.org - a community portal for Bacolod City government services.

As an early contributor to BetterGov.ph, I was inspired to create something for my hometown. The site compiles publicly available government info into a user-friendly format.

Features:
• 45+ government services with requirements & fees
• City officials, departments & 61 barangays directory
• Transparency data (flood control, budget, procurement)

Built for ₱435.39. Open source: github.com/betterbacolod/betterbacolod
