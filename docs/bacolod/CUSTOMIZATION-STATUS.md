**Fix:** Commit b44aa45 - Added Transportation and Public Safety categories
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue 2: Empty Service Listings (Fixed Jan 11)

**Problem:** /services/transportation and /services/public-safety showing empty cards

**Fix:** Commit 40e1af1 - Added transportationIndex and publicSafetyIndex imports
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## ⚠️ Remaining Issues

### Generic "Your LGU" Text in index.yaml Files

**Affected Files:**

- `content/services/housing-land-use/index.yaml`
- `content/services/infrastructure-public-works/index.yaml`
- `content/services/health-services/index.yaml`
- `content/services/education/index.yaml`
- `content/services/agriculture-fisheries/index.yaml`
- `content/services/business/index.yaml`

**Issue:** Service descriptions still contain generic text like "your local government" instead of "Bacolod City Government"

**Impact:** Minor - only affects service card descriptions, actual content files are fine

**Recommendation:** Update descriptions in index.yaml files to use Bacolod-specific language

**Estimated Files:** 4
**Agencies to Research:**

- Local Civil Registrar (birth/death/marriage certificates)
- Public Attorney's Office (PAO) Bacolod

2. **Environment** (2 files) - BENRO clean-up drives, reporting violations
3. **Infrastructure** (4 files) - Road repairs, public facilities, water supply

### Priority 3: Lower Priority Categories

**Optional (City-focused, less relevant):**

1. **Agriculture & Fisheries** (4 files) - Limited applicability for urban Bacolod
2. **Disaster Preparedness** (3 files) - Already covered extensively in Phase 7

### Priority 4: Polish & Quality

- Update all index.yaml files to remove generic "your LGU" language
- Add more Bacolod-specific context and local knowledge
